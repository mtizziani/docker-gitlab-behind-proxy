# docker-gitlab-behind-proxy
Start a gitlab CE behind a nginx https proxy with docker-compose

## Why this project?
The reason is simple. I searched a long time to get a docker-compose config for running on my server.

## My solution
I build several docker-compose setup for it. The first includes my proxy and the second holds the setup for my gitlab.

### want more?
comming soon ...
